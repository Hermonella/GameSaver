# GameSaver
A Simple script to copy savegames to a folder. Perfect for cloud storage Like dropbox etc.


How to use:

WARNING! Always make a manual backup of your savegame before you test the script the first time!

1. Place the bat file in a folder.

2. Make a copy of the template located in the bottom.

3. Replace GameName with the name of the game, and LocalSaveGameLocation with the location of the folder that contains the save. Do not remove "./" inside the path.

4. Add your game to the listing (see in the top of the script, follow the template)


This should be very straight forward, if not please make a post on how i can improve this readme.
